# drafts

Monaco editor for writing actions in [Drafts 5](https://getdrafts.com/). Definitions are put together using the [typescript definitions](https://github.com/agiletortoise/drafts-script-reference/tree/master/src) that power the [docs](https://scripting.getdrafts.com/).

## Motivation

This app was born from a desire to write JS code for Drafts, but lacking tools I had come to enjoy.

## Future

I'd like to add ESLint support!
